reduce wastage. Everyday people spend a lot of time in the kitchen to tackle this,

We will be developing an application called the Smart Refrigerator â€“ a camera with

barcode scanner along with image processing software for inventory and item

recognition. In our project we will implement an automated android based system that

suggest food recipes we can make from the current food stuff available. Improves the

overall efficiency and utilization of the all food products. The application will detect
